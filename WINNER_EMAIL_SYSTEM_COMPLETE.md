## 🔧 **Key Files Modified:**

## 🚀 **How to Test the Complete System:**

### **Step 1: Environment Setup**
Make sure your `.env` file in the backend has:
```bash
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password
```

### **Step 2: Start the System**
```bash
# Backend (Port 5001)
cd backend
node server.js

# Frontend (Port 3000 or 3001)
cd frontend
npm start
```

### **Step 3: Test Email Functionality**
**Option A: Test Email Endpoint**
```bash
# Send test winner email to your account
POST http://localhost:5001/api/auctions/test-winner-notification
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

**Option B: Real Auction Test**
1. Create an auction that ends soon
2. Place bids on it
3. Use force-end endpoint:
   ```bash
   POST http://localhost:5001/api/auctions/AUCTION_ID/force-end
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
   ```
4. Check your email for winner notification!

### **Step 4: Test Frontend Winner Notifications**
1. Go to "My Bids" page
2. Click "Show Auctions Won" button
3. See your won auctions in a beautiful modal
