# Auction Winner Email Notification System

## Overview
This implementation adds email notifications for auction winners when an auction ends. The system automatically detects ended auctions, creates winner records, and sends congratulatory emails to the winning bidders.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Service Enhancement
**File**: `backend/utils/email.js`
- Added `sendWinnerNotificationEmail()` function
- Creates beautiful HTML email with auction details, winner information, and next steps
- Includes styling and professional layout

### 2. Winner Controller Updates
**File**: `backend/controllers/winnerController.js`
- Added `sendWinnerNotification()` function
- Handles email sending and updates notification status
- Includes error handling and logging

### 3. Auction Route Updates
**File**: `backend/routes/auction.js`
- Enhanced `saveWinnerIfEnded()` function to send emails automatically
- Added manual endpoints for testing and processing ended auctions:
  - `POST /api/auctions/process-ended-auctions` - Manual trigger for ended auctions
  - `POST /api/auctions/test-winner-notification` - Test email sending

### 4. Auction Scheduler Service
**File**: `backend/utils/auctionScheduler.js`
- Automated background service that runs every 5 minutes
- Checks for ended auctions and processes winners
- Creates winner records and sends email notifications
- Includes comprehensive logging and error handling

### 5. Server Integration
**File**: `backend/server.js`
- Integrated auction scheduler to start automatically with server
- Added graceful shutdown handling
- Scheduler runs continuously in the background

### 6. Frontend Winner Notifications
**File**: `frontend/src/components/WinnerNotifications.jsx`
- Beautiful modal component showing winner notifications
- Displays auction details, winning bid amount, and contact information
- Professional styling with animations and responsive design

### 7. App Integration
**Files**: 
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Global winner notifications
- `frontend/src/pages/BidderPage.jsx` - Page-specific winner notifications

## How It Works

### Automatic Process:
1. Scheduler runs every 5 minutes checking for ended auctions
2. Updates auction status from 'active' to 'ended'
3. Creates winner record in database
4. Sends congratulatory email to winner
5. Marks winner as notified

### Manual Triggers:
- Admin can manually process ended auctions via API endpoint
- Test email functionality for development/testing

### Email Content:
- Professional congratulatory message
- Auction details (title, winning bid, auction ID)
- Winner information (name, email, phone)
- Next steps for payment and delivery
- Branded styling with colors and icons

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (already configured):
```bash
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@auctionsystem.com
```

### Database Models:
- Winner model includes `notified` field to track email status
- Auction model tracks status and winner information

## Testing

### Test Winner Email:
```bash
POST /api/auctions/test-winner-notification
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

### Manual Process Ended Auctions:
```bash
POST /api/auctions/process-ended-auctions
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```
